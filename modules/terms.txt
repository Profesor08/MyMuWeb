NB:

A &ldquo;suspension&rdquo; is a temporary exclusion, whereas  a &ldquo;ban&rdquo; is a permanent exclusion. 
All punishments within reason are up to the MM\'s  discretion up to and including IP banning for any offence. 
When  multiple rules have been broken, this will be taken into consideration  and the punishment may be greater than that of the individual offences. 
The player&rsquo;s record of past offences will also be taken  into consideration; all characters on the same account will be recorded  together; i.e. a first offence on one character will mean the next  offence on any character is treated as a second offence. 


HOW TO REPORT RULE BREAKERS WITH SCREENSHOTS 
It is important that you take appropriate screenshots. This means the  maximum conversation log must be visible and legible while keeping the  actual screen content partly visible.
Press F4 until the conversation window takes up the full height of the  screen and alter the transparency of this window so that the writing is  clear and legible, but not so that the window is fully opaque.
Screenshots where very little of the conversation window is shown may be deemed  inadmissible as evidence and dismissed.
